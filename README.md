A force directed graph simulation that uses spring and gravitational forces to rearrange vertices on the screen, optimizing the potential energy of the system. Controls are a little complicated. 
Click or 'X' -- new vertex; 
Hold enter -- toggle edge command; 
Hold 'Z' -- delete node command; 
Shift -- works like backspace for commands; 
'C' -- cancel a command; 
'=' -- create a new random graph; 
'F' -- toggle spring forces
